# What is Functional Programming(FP)?
*A style of programming which aims to avoid side-effects by using, as much as possible,
pure functions that manipulate immutable data*<br>
<br>
* **Side Effects**
 * Interaction with real world -- Logging, Printing, Inputs and Outputs etc.
 * Lack of Referential Transparency (RT)
* **Pure Functions and Purity rules**
  * Determinism -- Pure functions will always return the same output when given the same input

  ```scala
  def add(a: Int, b; Int): Int vs def rand(a: Int): Int
  Unit
 ```
  * Totality    -- Pure functions from type A => B have to be defined for every value of its domain (A)

  ```scala
   def divide(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a/b
   def divide(a: Int, b: Int): Option[Int] = Try(a/b).toOption
   ```

---

# Functional Programming Concepts

  * Pure Functions and Purity Rules (cont)
   * Referential Transparency(RT) -- Pure function calls should be replacable by their results without
  alterting the meaning of the program
  **An expression can be replaced by its value without changing the behavior of a program**
  ```scala
   def launchBomb: Unit = ???
   def formatString(s: String): String = {
    launchBomb
    s.toUpperCase
   }
```
  * What RT gives you?
   * Maintainable Code
   * Behavior is explicit and expected
   * Refactoring is less painful
   * Local Reasoning (Equational Reasoning) is possible

# FP vs OOP(s)
FP approach when it comes to the relationship between data and behavior
Aim is to completely separate data from behavior
* Define types (ADT) on one side that exposes no behavior and only holds data
* Define functions that take values of some of these types as inputs, acting on them and
outputting values of some of those types (leaving the input values unchanged -- immutability)

OOP approach is to combine data and behavior by creating classes that
* Store data(attributes) as an internal state
* Define end expose methods that act on it and may mutate it


---

# Polymorphism
Increase code re-use by using more generic code.
There are 3 different kinds of polymorphism
1. **Subtyping aka subtype polymorphism**<br>
   Within one type, you have a subset of values making another type

2. **Parametric Polymorphism aka Generics**<br>
   **List[String]** should behave the same as **List[Int]**.  Type Parameters let us define a whole implementation
   where instead of a type we put a placeholder and when we supplement it with a concrete type, the
   implementation is materialized.  Mathematical way of looking at it -- A Type constructor could be **List[_]** which takes a parameter like say **String** and then
   returns a concrete type e.g. **List[String]**

3. **Ad-hoc polymorphism aka operator overloading**<br>
You have * (or +) operator and you want to be able to use if for multiplying: ints, longs, doubles, floats, complex numbers, vectors, matrices… For each type it would have a slightly different implementation, so you cannot just create one function that rules them all, and simply adjust the type (as is the case with parametric polymorphism), nor extract common behavior (what matrices multiplication has in common with multiplying scalars?).

---

# Typeclasses
The Solution described in the paper [How to make ad-hoc polymorphism less
ad-hoc](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/topics/type-classes.html) works as follows
* Let us define a named contract.  This contract would require, that for a type certain functions would
have to be defined and meet certain assertions
* When type declared itself as following the said contract, then somewhere in the **scope** of the program
required functions have to be defined and explicitly pointed to
* operators have assigned contracts, and are used as syntactic sugar for functions mentioned in their contracts
* on contract can inherit obligations from another contract and add to them

Such contracts would be named **type classes**.

# Typeclasses in Scala
Odersky found an idea of type classes appealing and wanted to have them in Scala.  He chose the following choices:

* type classes with be implemented as actual classes. Or trait. This way you will have to guarantee,
* wherever you use a type class, you will call a method on an actual instance which will store all necessary information about types inside,
* the fact that you call this code from type-erased generic implementation that could have been compiler somewhere else won’t be an issue, because you will use dependency injection to get it.

Thing is, usually, you want to have only one type class for each type in the scope. Additionally, such usage would
introduce clumsiness the original solution hasn’t. Therefore the idea of implicits was born. **Originally, implicits
were introduced as a way of automatically passing type classes where needed basing solely on their type.**

**FP Tools and Abstractions are exclusively delivered via Typeclasses**

# Anatomy of a Typeclass (I)
There are three main important components to a typeclass pattern
1. **Typeclass**<br>
The typeclass is an interface/contract/api that represents some functionality we want to implement.  In Cats/Scalaz its
represented by a ***trait*** with at least one type parameter<br>

```scala
// Define a very simple Json ADT
sealed trait Json
final case class JsObject(get: Map[String, Json]) extends Json
final case class JsString(get: String) extends Json
final case class JsNumber(get: Double) extends Json
final case object JsNull extends Json

// The serialize to Json behavior is encoded in this typeclass
trait JsonWriter[A] {
 def write(value: A): Json
}
```

---

# Anatomy of a Typeclass (II)
The ** Instances** of the typeclass provide implementations for the types we care about especially the types from our domain
model
```scala
// Domain model
final case class Person(name: String, age: Int, email: String)

// Instances of the type class
object JsonWriterIntances {
 implicit val stringWriter: JsonWriter[String] =
  new JsonWriter[String] {
   def write(value: String): Json =
    JsString(value)https://i.imgur.com/8L0BuEx.png
  }

  implicit val personWriter: JsonWriter[Person] =
   new JsonWriter[Person] {
    def write(value: Person): Json =
     JsObject(Map(
      "name"  -> JsString(value.name),
      "age"   -> JsNumber(value.age),
      "email" -> JsString(value.email)
      ))
    }
}
```

---

# Anatomy of a Typeclass (III)
The **Interface** of the typeclass is any functionality we expose to users.  Interfaces are generic methods that accept
instances of the type class as implicit parameters.  There are 2 common ways of specifying an interface: ***Interface
Objects*** and ***Interface Syntax***

**Interface Objects**<br>

```scala
object Json {
 def toJson[A](value: A)(implicit w: JsonWriter[A]): Json =
  w.write(value)
}
Json.toJson(Person("John", 21, "john@john.com"))
```

**Interface Syntax**<br>

```scala
object JsonSyntax {
 implicit class JsonWriterOps[A](value: A) {
  def toJson(implicit w: JsonWriter[A]): Json =
   w.write(value)
  }
}
Person("John", 21, "john@john.com").toJson
```

# Cats Show + Eq Type classes

1. **Show**<br>

```scala
trait Show[A] {
 def show(value: A): String
}
// Instance
implicit val dateShow: Show[Date] =
Show.show(date => s"${date.getTime}ms since epoch")
```

[Details on Show](https://typelevel.org/cats/typeclasses/show.html) <br>

2. **Eq**<br>

```scala
trait Eq[A] {
 def eqv(a: A, b: A): Boolean
}
// Instance
implicit val dateEq: Eq[Date] =
 Eq.instance[Date]{{date1, date2) =>
  date1.getTime === date2.getTime
}
 ```
